A super simple BlackJack.

Things to resolve:
- what if write another word that isn't "yes" or "no"?

Things to add:
- A full Suit of cards (4 repetition in total of every number)
- Once a full Suite is used, this can be used again (card counting).
- An opponent o many. (this will make the card counting thing more interesting)
